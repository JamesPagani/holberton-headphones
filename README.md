# Holberton Headphones project

## About this project
The Headphones project combines everything we have learned on the [Advanced HTML](https://github.com/JamesPagani/holbertonschool-web_front_end/tree/master/0x00-html_advanced), [Advanced CSS](https://github.com/JamesPagani/holbertonschool-web_front_end/tree/master/0x02-CSS_advanced), [Responsive Design](https://github.com/JamesPagani/holbertonschool-web_front_end/tree/master/0x06-responsive_design), and [Accessibility](https://github.com/JamesPagani/holbertonschool-web_front_end/tree/master/0x07-accessibility) projects. Unlike those projects, however, we are not supplied with a starter HTML and CSS documents, forcing us to _design the whole website from scrath_ based on the following Figma templates (designed by Nicolas Philippot):

### Desktop view
![Desktop view of the website][desktop_version]

### Tablet view
![Tablet view of the website][tablet_version]

### Mobile view
![Mobile view of the website][mobile_version]

## The goal
As described above: Create a **responsive web page** similar to the images above from scratch.

## Files
Each HTML and CSS file fully implements a section of the full website, from the hero section to the footer:
- 0-index.html and 0-styles.css implement the header, navigation, and hero section.
- 1-index.html and 1-styles.css implement the "What we do..." section.
- 2-index.html and 2-styles.css implement the "Our results (...)" section.
- 3-index.html and 3-styles.css implement the "Contact us" section.
- 4-index.html and 4-styles.css implement the footer.

All images used on the index.html files are in the images folder.
